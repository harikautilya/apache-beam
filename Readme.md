# Repo Description

This is showcase project to understand how dataflow and apache beam works. The project also introduces an effort towards
understand how company's revenue an d expectations are converted to technical software. In more realistic scenarios 
1. there are lot more process and lot more research goes into decision-making. 
2. There are more explanation for each product decision.

This project is simplified to just PRD and SRS to facilitate my need of learning. If any mistakes are found, please correct it by opening a PR . 

This project is developed to understand how to interact with the api and how to interface each application around the concepts 
of the apache beam technologies, spring boot. The project also focus on documentation of such use-cases as to how SRS, 
HLD and LLD designs are prepared to solve the use case. 
To facilitate this and having AI being the great interest in the recent time, Worden, a data company is imagined
and the following problem is described. 

`Imagined` being the keyword across all assumptions
